## Introduction

A template to build things using [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/) and its [`standalone`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output) mode.

Taking into consideration what is mentioned in the [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/output), it is defined the `standalone` mode in [`next.config.ts`](./next.config.ts).

On top of that, it is customized the [`build` script](./package.json), so it generates the respective code but also the static content.

Finally, it is customized the [`start` script](./package.json), so it uses the server generated by the `standalone` mode.

> [!NOTE]
> As additional notes, it implements [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) with [`commitlint`](https://commitlint.js.org/) and [`husky`](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to [automate the generation of releases](./.github/workflows/release.yml). 
> It also brings [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) as coding formatter.

> [!NOTE]
> The used [`commitlint` configuration](https://github.com/d3p1/commitlint-config) forces you to write commit messages with the following format: `<type>(<scope>): <description> [<issue-number>]`.

> [!NOTE]
> This template comes with a [startup script](./.idea/runConfigurations/Dev.xml) for [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). However, the script will only run if this template is used inside a [`docknext`](https://github.com/d3p1/docknext) environment with the following folder structure: a `<doc-root>/infra` folder where the `docker` files/services live, and a `<doc-root>/www` folder where this template lives.

## Usage

Update the [`README.md`](README.md), specifically the badges.

Update the following [`package.json`](package.json) settings:

- `description`
- `repository.url`
- `author`
- `bugs.url`
- `homepage`
- `keywords`

Finally, to deploy your app, run:

- `npm run build`
- `npm run start`

> [!NOTE]
> You can configure [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) with your IDE to use the proposed template configuration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [`release`](./.github/workflows/release.yml) and [`publish`](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) [GitHub Actions](./.github/workflows) use [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en), so to avoid errors you should manage your dependencies with [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/).
